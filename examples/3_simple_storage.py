# WHAT IS IN THIS EXAMPLE?
#
# Keybase has added an encrypted key-value store intended to support
# security-conscious bot development with persistent state. It is a place to
# store small bits of data that are
#   (1) encrypted for a team or user (via the user's implicit self-team: e.g.
# alice,alice),
#   (2) persistent across logins
#   (3) fast and durable.
#
# It supports putting, getting, listing, and deleting. There is also concurrency
# support, but check out 5_secret_storage.py for that. A team has many
# namespaces, a namespace has many entryKeys, and an entryKey has one current
# entryValue. Namespaces and entryKeys are in cleartext, and the Keybase client
# service will encrypt and sign the entryValue on the way in (as well as
# decrypt and verify on the way out) so keybase servers cannot see it or forge
# it.
#
# This example shows how you can use KVStoreClient to interact with the team
# encrypted key-value store.
